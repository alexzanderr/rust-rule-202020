# Rule 20 20 20
This is a utility software to make you pause what you are doing every X minutes, which are passed from command line.

The app waits X minutes then warnings the user by playing Half Life game wav sounds to look away from the computer or screen for 20 seconds long. You can also keep your eyes closed during the activation of 20 20 20 rule.

This is a great tool for keeping your eye healthy as a developer.

Personally I've used this software for about 1 year and the state of my eyes improved dramatically.
